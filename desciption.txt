🚗 DriveSense AI – Full-Stack Automobile Chatbot (MERN)

I recently enhanced DriveSense, an AI-powered automobile chatbot designed to provide vehicle comparisons, mileage insights, maintenance information, and structured vehicle data through natural conversation.

The application is built using the MERN stack (React with Vite, Node.js, Express, MongoDB) and integrates the OpenAI API for intelligent, context-aware responses. The backend follows a clean, scalable architecture with dedicated models, RESTful routes, and database seeding for vehicle data, while chat history is persistently stored in MongoDB.

On the frontend, I implemented React Context for global state management and introduced a dynamic, switchable background animation system (Highway, Dashboard, Engine, Cityscape, Blueprint) to enhance the user experience without compromising code maintainability.

This project strengthened my full-stack development skills, AI integration, state management, and UI/UX design practices.
